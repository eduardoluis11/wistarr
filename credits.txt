# Play - Free HTML Template for Startup, Apps and SaaS

Play is an open-source and free bootstrap 5 based HTML template created by the UIdeck team. It's a part of our new initiative to give back to the community and create some impactful open source projects.

This template is designed and developed in such a way so, that almost anyone can use it for almost any kind of website or landing pages such as SaaS, Startup, Business, Apps, Software and Agency, etc.

Play comes with all essential sections and elements a complete website needs, additionally, we also created some separate pages including blogs, login, 404, and some other essential pages from homepage sections.
